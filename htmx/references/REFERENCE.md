## Package Guides

| Domain | File | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| Attributes | `references/attributes.md` | All `hx-*` attributes, their accepted values, modifiers, and inheritance behavior |
| Requests | `references/requests.md` | Triggering requests, headers (request/response), parameters, file uploads, CSRF, CORS, caching |

| Extensions | `references/extensions.md` | Official extensions: WebSockets (`ws`), SSE (`sse`), Idiomorph (`morph`), response targets, head support, preload |

## Common Task Routing

- Add AJAX behavior to a button/link/form: read `references/attributes.md`
- Configure when a request fires (polling, debounce, keyboard shortcuts): read `references/requests.md`
- Control where the response goes and how it renders: read `references/swapping.md`
- Update multiple parts of the page from one response: read `references/swapping.md` (OOB swaps section)
- Listen for HTMX events or call the JS API: read `references/events-api.md`
- Set up extensions (SSE, WebSockets, Idiomorph, preload, response-targets, head-support): read `references/extensions.md`
- Implement a common UI pattern (search box, infinite scroll, modals): read `references/patterns.md`
- Integrate with third-party JS libraries: read `references/events-api.md` (scripting section)
- Security hardening (CSRF, CSP, XSS prevention): read `references/requests.md` (security section)

## Suggested Reading Order

1. Start with this file.
2. Open one domain file for the immediate task.
3. Open additional files only when cross-domain integration is required.
